/**
 * Yagna Market API
 *  ## Yagna Market The Yagna Market is a core component of the Yagna Network, which enables computational Offers and Demands circulation. The Market is open for all entities willing to buy computations (Demands) or monetize computational resources (Offers). ## Yagna Market API The Yagna Market API is the entry to the Yagna Market through which Requestors and Providers can publish their Demands and Offers respectively, find matching counterparty, conduct negotiations and make an agreement.  This version of Market API conforms with capability level 1 of the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zny_vfgWV-hcsKS7P-Kdr3Fb0dwfl-6T_cYKVQ9mkNg\"> Market API specification</a>.  Market API contains two roles: Requestors and Providers which are symmetrical most of the time (excluding agreement phase).

     * Sends a response to a received property value query.  The Market Matching Mechanism, when resolving the match relation for the specific Demand-Offer pair, is to detect the “dynamic” properties required (via constraints) by the other side. At this point, it is able to query the issuing node for those properties and submit the other side’s requested properties as the context of the query.  **Note**: The property query responses may be submitted in “chunks”, ie. the responder may choose to resolve ‘quick’/lightweight’ properties faster and provide response sooner, while still working on more time-consuming properties in the background. Therefore the response contains both the resolved properties, as well as list of properties which responder knows still require resolution.  **Note**: This method must be implemented for Market API Capability Level 2.
